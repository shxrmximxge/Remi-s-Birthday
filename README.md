  <h1>Happy 18th Birthday! 🎉</h1>
  <div class="heart">💛💛💛</div>
  <p>To my dear friend,</p>

  <p>
    Since October 28, 2017, you've been one of the most special people in my life.
    Through every up, every down, every silence, and every “I thought this was the last time” — we’ve still managed to find our way back to each other. And that means <strong>everything</strong> to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ve been there for me when things got tough, and I hope you know how much I appreciate that.
    Even when life pulled us apart for a while, we always made our way back,
    wishing each other happy birthdays like a tradition that never fades.
    And now, here we are, and you're turning 18! 🎂
  </p>

  <p>
    Happy birthday, my friend. Eighteen looks good on you —
    full of new beginnings, grown-up dreams, and more memories to make.
    I’m so lucky to know you, and I hope we keep finding our way back to each other, always.
  </p>
